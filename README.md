# 3D-Puzzle-Platformer
A 3D, Super-mario-Style platformer/puzzle game made in Unity for my year 12 High School Multimedia Major Project. Achieved a band 6 with over 90% for the project and its accompanying documentation portfolio. All models, music, GUI, scripts were developed by myself as this was an individual major project.
